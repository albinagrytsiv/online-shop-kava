        <h2 class="mission-title">WE'RE ON A MISSION</h2>
        <p class="mission-description">Since our passionate founder Will Young opened his first Campos café in Newtown in 2002, we’ve been on a mission to help everyone love great coffee as much as we do. We believe in coffee’s ability to inspire genuine optimism and joy. From your very first sip things magically get better; conversations flow freely, grand ideas flourish and new connections feel like old friends.</p>

        <h2 class="beginning-title">WHERE IT ALL BEGAN</h2>
        <p class="beginning-date">1:40PM, SATURDAY, 12TH JULY 1997</p>
        <p class="beginning-story">That was the day when in a small café in the backstreets of Sydney, Will Young had a life-changing moment. Up until this day, he had known coffee only to be a generic scalding liquid that people drank to cure tiredness – something endured more out of necessity than pleasure. But this cup was different. It was unlike anything he’d ever experienced before. It had a depth of flavour that was rich, sweet and complex along with an aroma that made him giddy with delight. Compared to coffees of the past, this was simply a superior experience. By the time the cup was empty, he knew life would be different. From that day forward, he decided to devote his life to introducing more people to great coffee.</p>
        <p class="beginning-epiphany">On his first visit to a coffee-growing origin, he had his second epiphany. It was there he saw the power and immense potential that coffee had to transform lives and communities in producing countries. What started as a delicious cup of coffee in Newtown was now a heartfelt mission to create more good in the world.</p>
